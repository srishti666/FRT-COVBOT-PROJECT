# COVBOT

This is my project for Future Ready Talent Program

## Problem Statement
Healthcare is arguably the most important industry now and patients need quick access to health information and medical facilities. AI in healthcare can be used to cut down on human labor to easily access, analyze and provide healthcare professionals with a list of possible diagnoses in a matter of seconds.Chatbots have the potential to revolutionize healthcare. They can substantially boost efficiency and improve the accuracy of symptom detection and reduce the anxiety due to the increasing covid cases nowadays.
## Project Description
Developed a Azure Health bot using Azure Services. The Project intregates a bot which is made with QnA Maker in a static website which help end users to enquire about covid-19 related information. They can work in tandem with governments and health services to stop the worried well not at risk from the virus from seeking treatment, and also support people to self-care where that is appropriate .It can generate answers to common questions, such as on the ways of transmission of the virus, or the most common and serious symptoms.It is effectively designed and deployed. It could help us by sharing information quickly, encouraging desired health impacting behaviors, and lessening the psychological damage caused by fear and isolation. Despite this potential, the risk of amplifying misinformation and the lack of prior effectiveness research is cause for concern.

### Primary Azure Technology
Azure Bot Service, Azure Cognitive Search, QnA Maker
